# Introduction-to-Python
Throughout Programming for Data Science's course, we were challenged with 3 Homeworks, to enhance our Python Skills. In general, each of these Homeworks focused on:

**1. Introductory and General Python skills**. Flow Control Statement, Data Structures, Functions and Mathematical challenges.
**2. Pandas Exploration**. Exploring Pandas' methods, combining it with if and elif statements, in order to gain insights regarding the data.
**3. Numpy, Matplotlib and K-Means clustering**. Exploring numpy and its methods, understanding how can we use Matplotlib for graphical representations and experimenting with K-Means to produce clusters out of the existing data.
